I am an open-source advocate and tech enthusiast. I'm always open to collaborate
with people on great projects. I spent the last years studying and applying new
software architectures, adding programming languages to my toolbox, doing deploys,
writing [blog posts](https://www.github.com/suriyaJaboon), traveling around the
world and doing many other things.

#### Whatever I do, I always do with a developer's mindset:

1. Analyze the problem
2. Break the one big problem into smaller sub-problems
3. Solve them one by one
4. Always search for a better solution
